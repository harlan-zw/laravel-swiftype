Laravel Swiftype is a wrapper for [elastic/app-search](https://www.elastic.co/products/app-search) with some Laravel
specific helpers to make integrating your Eloquent Models with Swiftype a breeze.

## Installation

Via Composer

``` bash
composer require loonpwn/laravel-swiftype
```

If you do not run Laravel 5.5 (or higher), then add the service provider in `config/app.php`:

```
Loonpwn\Swiftype\SwiftypeServiceProvider::class,
```


## Usage

In your `.env` file, add the following variables.
```
SWIFTYPE_DEFAULT_ENGINE=
SWIFTYPE_API_PRIVATE_KEY=
SWIFTYPE_HOST_IDENTIFIER=
```

Get your keys from the [Swiftype Credentials](https://app.swiftype.com/as#/credentials) page.

When self-hosting an instance of AppSearch, you can use the API Endpoint displayed on the credentials page as 
`SWIFTYPE_HOST_IDENTIFIER`, e.g.:

```
SWIFTYPE_HOST_IDENTIFIER=http://localhost:3002
```

### API

This packages has two Facades which give you access to the underlying Swiftype client.

#### Swiftype

The `Swiftype` facade is a direct wrapper for the built client from https://github.com/elastic/app-search-php. Any 
command from the base client can be used on this facade. Example:

- `Swiftype::listEngines($currentPage = null, $pageSize = null)` - Show all engines available

- `Swiftype::createEngine($name, $language = 'en')` - Find an engine based on name

With IDE auto-complete:

````php
/** @var \Loonpwn\Swiftype\Clients\Api $api */
$api = app(Swiftype::class);
````

#### SwiftypeEngine

The `SwiftypeEngine` is a wrapper on top of the `Swiftype` facade with direct context of the default engine. Many of the
 same functions from the core API is available in this facade without the need to specify an engine. 

`SwiftypeEngine::search($query, $options)` - Search documents within the engine

`SwiftypeEngine::indexDocument($document)` - Creates a new document, or updates an existing, based on the primary 
key. This function will use a transformer to make sure the primary key is transformed to just `id`. 

`SwiftypeEngine::indesDocuments($document)` - Similar as the above but will take a list of models and chunk them
to 100 per request

`SwiftypeEngine::deleteDocument($documentId)` - Removes a document.

`SwiftypeEngine::deleteDocuments($documentIds)` - Takes an array of document ids and removes them. 

`SwiftypeEngine::listDocuments($page = 1, $pageSize = 100)` - Lists documents that belong to the engine, with pagination.

`SwiftypeEngine::listAllDocumentsByPages($action, $page = 1, $pageSize = 100)` - Lists documents that belong to the engine, 
will iterate through all pages and call your custom action.

`SwiftypeEngine::purgeAllDocuments()` - Will remove all documents from Swiftype


### Traits
 
`IsSwiftypeDocument` is a trait available which hooks into the models `saved` event hook. The following happens on
saved:
  - `shouldSyncSwiftypeOnSave` is checked and must pass true to continue
  - `getSwiftypeAttributes` is called to get the attributes to send to Swiftype 

You should override these functions for business specific logic.

```php
/**
 * Should model changes be pushed to Swiftype. Excludes deleting
 * @return bool
 */
public function shouldSyncSwiftypeOnSave()
{
    // by default all model changes are pushed to swiftype
    return true;
}

/**
 * Get the mapped attribute values for Swiftype
 * @return mixed|null
 */
public function getSwiftypeAttributes()
{
    // Document transformer is the default transformer, feel free to implement your own
    return transform($this, new DocumentTransformer());
}
```

### Jobs

Currently only jobs directly related to the Eloquent Model events are created. These can be used to queue the data sync.

- `DeleteDocument($documentId)` - Delete a particular document, takes the document id
- `IndexDocument($document)` - Pushes the individual document. Takes the mapped document 
- `SyncDocuments` - Iterates through all documents in Swiftype and local DB to find documents out of sync and eithers
adds or removes them. This uses the `swiftype.sync_models` configuration


## Testing

$ composer test
```
